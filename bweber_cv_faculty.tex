\section{{\sectionfont Research Interests}}

My research interests generally lie in developing tools to apply fundamental
combustion insights to solve engineering problems. My recent work
involves developing experimental methods to analyze intermediate species
at practical combustion conditions. I am also interested in developing
methods to analyze computational models, particularly kinetic models of
combustion.
