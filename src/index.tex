\runsubsection{Staff Software Engineer}\location{| March 2024 – June 2024}\\
\runsubsection{Senior Software Engineer}\location{| August 2022 – March 2024}\\
\descript{Rebellion Defense}; defense tech startup valued over \$1B, building software for battlefield analysis.

\begin{itemize}
\item Lead Python developer on a modular and scalable microservice-based system to process tens-to-hundreds of thousands of sensor messages for battlefield observability. Built with Python, golang, gRPC, and RabbitMQ.
\item Led 1-month integration of ML algorithms for a \$1M/year contract. Enabled evaluating thousands of potential actions per second, while current capabilities are limited to dozens per day.
\item Led as the subject matter expert for ML-based task assignment algorithms during \$1M/year-contract close-out demonstration to the Chief Scientist of the Air Force.
\item Integrated LLM-generated action report summaries in our adversary emulation software. Used the OpenAI API with an optimized prompt to produce high-level overviews for non-technical stakeholders.
\item Developed pipelines that rapidly deployed ML models to perform cyber-asset criticality assessment and automated training data generation. Used Flyte, Kubernetes, and AWS EKS to maintain model provenance.
% \item Championed developer productivity by seeking out and implementing more efficient tools while strategically removing unused ones. Added \verb|pantsbuild| to three repositories working with approximately 20 engineers and contributed in-house features back upstream to the open-source project.
\item Founding member of a cross-disciplinary team focused on cultivating a positive and inclusive work environment through initiatives promoting empathy, team building, and open communication.
\item Reviewed hundreds of code changes from dozens of team members. Emphasized driving customer value, fostering team growth, and shared skill development.

\runsubsection{Open Source Software Engineer}\location{| January 2022 – May 2022}\\
\descript{Coiled Computing}; early stage SaaS startup making cloud management tools integrated with the Dask ecosystem.

% Worked with GB-TB scale Parquet files to find and fix performance bottlenecks with cloud (S3) storage
% Merged 15 PRs in 4 months
% Refactored DataFrame creation APIs to use high-level graphs, enabling performance optimizations
% Developed Coiled Cloud widget for v2
% Participated in community team issue triage, question answering
\begin{itemize}
\item Led performance improvement feature for Dask to enable loading terabyte-scale Parquet data from cloud storage. Results led to changing recommendations for settings in Dask to prevent out-of-memory errors.
\item Led development of a highly-requested dashboard to display cluster status in the Coiled client.
% \item Optimized task graph generation in Dask by improving three Dask DataFrame APIs
% \item Added hooks for \verb|dask.distributed.Client| to run user-supplied preload plugins
